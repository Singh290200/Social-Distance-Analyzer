A social distancing analyzer tool to regulate social distancing protocol using video
surveillance of CCTV cameras and drones. Social Distancing Analyser to prevent COVID19.


Motivation of the Project: -
• Surveillance for social distancing in crowded places
• To control the spread of COVID-19 pandemic


Definition of the problem: -
One way of limiting the spread of Covid-19, is to practice social distancing. This is not aWork Plan:
⮚ Methodology
• Scoping and planning
• Collecting the training Data
• Training and validating the model
• Deployment
new concept, as most societies have been aware of the value of keeping away from people who
are suffering from an infection for many generations.The objective is to reduce transmission,
delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a
longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system.



Time Schedule
1.Collecting the Training Data:
Collecting the training data set to train the machine learning model, from different
sources(1st Week)
2. Preparing the dataset to be fed into the model for the training purpose(2nd Week)
3. Training and tuning the machine learning model for desired output generation and validation
of the output(3rd- 4th Week).
7. Exhaustive testing, Testing and validation of the created model at different scenarios. (5th
Week)
⮚ Proposed outcome/ findings
The proposed model successfully identifies the violation of social distancing in the
deployed region and is able to take the predefined action on configuration.
Utilization of the outcome of project:
Social Distancing Analyser automatically detects the extent to which social distancing
protocols are followed in the area. Deploying it on current surveillance systems and drones
used by police to monitor large areas can help to prevent coronavirus by allowing automated
and better tracking of activities happening in the area. It shows analytics of the area in real
time. It can also be used to alert police in case of considerable violation of social distancing
protocols in a particular area.
